# C-Sharp

This repository will present three small C# projects I created during this semester. 

## Selling-Application

The `Selling-Application` is a basic project made using classes only on Visual Studio, without the use of Microsoft SQL management server.

## Hospital-Application

The `Hospital-Application` uses forms and a database to create a more complex project, that uses a graphical interface.

## MultiLayer-Student-Application

The `MultiLayer-Student-Application` is the most complex project, which uses a database as well as a 3 layer repartition with a datalink layer, a business layer and an application layer.
